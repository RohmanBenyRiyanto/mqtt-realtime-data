# Flutter Project Setup and Build Instructions

This README provides step-by-step instructions for setting up a Flutter project, generating code with `build_runner`, and running the application using Flutter FVM with Flutter version 3.16.9.

## Prerequisites

- Ensure that Flutter FVM is installed. If not, you can install it using the following command:

  ```bash
  dart pub global activate fvm
  ```

- Initialize FVM and select Flutter version 3.16.9:

  ```bash
  fvm install 3.16.9
  fvm use 3.16.9
  ```

## Step 1: Clone the Repository

Clone the Flutter project repository to your local machine:

```bash
git clone <repository_url>
cd <project_directory>
```

## Step 2: Install Dependencies

Run the following command to fetch and install the project dependencies:

```bash
dart pub get
```

## Step 3: Generate Code with `build_runner`

To generate code using `build_runner`, use the following command:

```bash
dart run build_runner build --delete-conflicting-outputs
```

This command will generate any required files, such as JSON serialization code, during development. Ensure that you run this command whenever you make changes to the code that require regeneration.

## Step 4: Run the Flutter Application

Run the Flutter application using the following command:

```bash
flutter run
```

This command will launch the application on the connected device or emulator.

Now you have successfully set up and run your Flutter project with Flutter FVM using Flutter version 3.16.9. If you encounter any issues, please refer to the project documentation or seek assistance from the project contributors.
